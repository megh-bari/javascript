# Javascrript and classes

## OOP(Obect Oriented Programming)

## Object

- Collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Why we used OOP

## parts of OOP

- Object Literal
- Constructor Function()
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this - keywords)

## 4 pillars of OOP

- Abstraction - In short, Hide details liked fetch
- Encapsulation - In short, wrapped up data or Protects the data
- Inheritance - In short, Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.
- Polymorphism - Poly means many, morphism means swaprup, ek he methos works more works


🧵 Understanding the 4 Pillars of OOP: A Quick Guide for Developers 👩‍💻👨‍💻

1/ Abstraction:
Abstraction is all about hiding the complex details and showing only the necessary parts. Think of your car: You start it with a key or button, but you don’t need to know how the engine works. The inner workings are abstracted away, letting you focus on driving! 🚗

2/ Encapsulation:
Encapsulation bundles data and methods into a single unit, typically a class. Imagine a capsule: It holds all the medicinal materials inside, protecting them from the outside. Similarly, encapsulation keeps an object's data safe from external interference. 💊

3/ Inheritance:
Inheritance lets a class inherit properties and methods from another class. Think of it like a family tree: A child inherits traits from their parents, like eye color or height. Similarly, a Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, gaining all the Animal traits while adding its own unique behaviors, like bark(). 🧬➡️🐾


4/ Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different actions. Think of how a person behaves differently depending on the situation: casual with friends, professional with colleagues, and respectful with seniors. The same person (object) exhibits different behaviors based on the context—this is polymorphism in action! 🎭
